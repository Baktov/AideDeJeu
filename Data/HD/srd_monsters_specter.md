    ## Special Features


    **_Incorporeal Movement_**. The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.


    **_Sunlight Sensitivity_**. While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.


    ## Actions


    **_Life Drain_**. Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.


    _Hit_: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
