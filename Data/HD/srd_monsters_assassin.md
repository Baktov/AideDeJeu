    ## Special Features


    **_Assassinate_**. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.


    **_Evasion_**. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.


    **_Sneak Attack_**. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


    ## Actions


    **_Multiattack_**. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.


    **_Shortsword_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


    **_Light Crossbow_**. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
