## Special Features

**_Devil's Sight_**. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

**_Magic Resistance_**. The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The devil makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting.

**_Claw_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**_Sting_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
