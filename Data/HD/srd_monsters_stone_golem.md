    ## Special Features


    **_Immutable Form_**. The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.


    **_Magic Resistance_**. The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


    **_Magic Weapons_**. The golem's weapon attacks are magical.


    ## Actions


    **_Multiattack_**. The golem makes two slam attacks.


    **_Slam_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.


    **_Slow (Recharge 5-6)_**. The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
