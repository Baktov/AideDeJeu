## Special Features

**_Hold Breath_**. While out of water, the octopus can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

**_Underwater Camouflage_**. The octopus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while underwater.

**_Water Breathing_**. The octopus can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

**_Tentacles_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 1 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.

**_Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)_**. A 5-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
