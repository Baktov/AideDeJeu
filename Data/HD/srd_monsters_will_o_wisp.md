    ## Special Features


    **_Consume Life_**. As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 (3d6) hit points.


    **_Ephemeral_**. The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything.


    **_Incorporeal Movement_**. The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.


    **_Variable Illumination_**. The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5-to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.


    ## Actions


    **_Shock_**. Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.


    _Hit_: 9 (2d8) lightning damage.


    **_Invisibility_**. The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become invisible until it attacks or uses its Consume Life, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
