## Special Features

**_Lightning Absorption_**. Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

**_Slam_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**_Engulf_**. The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md), restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
