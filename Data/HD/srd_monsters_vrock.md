## Special Features

**_Magic Resistance_**. The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

**_Beak_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**_Talons_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Spores (Recharge 6)_**. A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself

**_on a success_**. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

**_Stunning Screech (1/Day)_**. The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the vrock's next turn.
