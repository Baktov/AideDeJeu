    ## Special Features


    **_Ice Walk_**. The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.


    **_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


    ## Actions


    **_Multiattack_**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.


    **_Bite_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.


    **_Claw_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.


    **_Tail_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.


    _Hit_: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.


    **_Frightful Presence_**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.


    **_Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)_**. The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


    ## Legendary Actions


    The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.


    **_Detect_**. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.


    **_Tail Attack_**. The dragon makes a tail attack.


    **_Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)_**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
