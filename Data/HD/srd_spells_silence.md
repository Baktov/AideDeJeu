# Silence

- MDR: [Silence](hd_spells_silence.md)
- Source: (SRD p179)
-  2nd-level illusion (ritual)
- **Casting Time :** 1 action
- **Range :** 120 feet

### Description

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it.

Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
